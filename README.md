### EventTrackerProject

### Overview
For this project I created and wired a spring repository service to create a database of completed raids for World of Warcraft. All CRUD operations can be completed in POSTMAN.

* Look up all raids or a single raid with /index or /index{id} and GET

* Users can create a new raid with a post on /create

* Users can update an item with /update{id} and a put to update the raids

* Lastly users can remove a raid with /delete{id}

### Overview Week 2
Created Javascript to list out my raid database into a table and perform CRUD operations on it. Unfortnately I was unable to get any sort of aggregation going. I think there was a way to do it to target the specific value of some element and iterate over it to find the average value I was just never really able to get that working which is pretty frustrating.


### Overview Week 3

For this project I created an event tracker front end through angular. The user lands on the website and has all abilities to perform CRUD operations. Honestly this portion felt a bit easier than the Javascript last week. I was stressed out but once I got the Index function working the rest sort of just fell into place.
