### EventTrackerProject

### Overview
For this project I created and wired a spring repository service to create a database of completed raids for World of Warcraft. All CRUD operations can be completed in POSTMAN.

* Look up all raids or a single raid with /index or /index{id} and GET

* Users can create a new raid with a post on /create

* Users can update an item with /update{id} and a put to update the raids

* Lastly users can remove a raid with /delete{id}
