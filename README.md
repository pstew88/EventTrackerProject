### FavoriteMusicList

### Overview
This program pulls a list of favorited music from a MySQL database and allows the user to perform basic Create, Read, Update and Delete methods. I decided to run the project through a mySQL Database and built out the back end in Java with restful services on a SpringBoot server to try to show off a little more of what I can do. All testing performed on the back end through J-unit and on the front end through error response in the chrome console.

The sort function was performed with a Directive so that it will resort and reorganize our table on each click event.

The other functions are created with Angular CRUD operations.

Thank you for this opportunity to show you what I know.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Functions

- To sort by headers click once on the header you want to sort by, again for the inverse.

- Click anywhere on the songs information to see a detailed list of the songs information

- From there you can choose to edit the songs information and save it.

- To delete a song simply click the X at the end of its row.

- Songs are filtered by selecting the dropdown box and selecting the year it should sort to.

- Finally to add a song just input its information and select add, an error will show if information was input improperly.
